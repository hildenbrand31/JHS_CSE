Welcome.  This is the source for a website I built for a Computer Science class I teach at Jasper High School in Jasper, Indiana. I have published this code for a variety of reasons. The first of which is that Git is new to me and I need the practice. It is a tool that I wish to teach my students in class and I must learn it first. Second, I want my students to see how the website works (such as it is). It's not overly conplicated and I mean for students to learn from it.
