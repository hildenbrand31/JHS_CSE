 <p>This site is a supplement to some of the course materials for the PLTW: Computer Science/Software Engineering course at Jasper High School.  I will provide links to working examples and downloads in easier to use formats (such as .zip instead of .rar).</p>
 <p>The headline above is an example of using <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> in a web page. It is not as hard as you would think.  Follow the link and pick a font. Google will provide some text-snippets to include in your html and css pages to get it to work.</p>

	<p>I have been checking on each of your individual websites.  If you have not uploaded an <a href="#index">index.html</a> file you need to do so IMMEDIATELY. Any simple html file will do.  You also have to edit the file to include your name in the footer portion of the page. You can check to see if it is working by clicking on the link above.</p>
	<h3><a id="index">The Default File</a></h3>
	<p>I don't know the numbers on this but based on observation and my own habits I believe that most people visiting the Internet do not specify know exactly what page they want to view. We simply enter the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and a webpage magically appears. This occurs because each web server is configured to send a default page to each visitor that does not request a specific one. Usually that file is named index.html or index.htm. The default page is a configurable setting on the web server and could just as easily be welcome.html or anything else the webmaster thinks suitable.</p>
	<p>A student asked, "What is the index.html page used for?" The answer is everything. It is the page that users will see first when they visit your site. Think of it as the main page and all your other pages can link from there.</p>
	<p>Each of you must have a web page with the name index.html in the root of your web server directory. I will check that one exists by clicking the links above. If you have one, it will appear when you click the link; if not, an error will appear. Please remember to add a footer to your page with your name so you get credit. When this is done and I have checked it, I will add your first name to the link to make it easier to find.</p>
