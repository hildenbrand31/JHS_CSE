Welcome
======

I teach a computer science class at Jasper High School in Jasper, IN. This is the source code for that site.

The need for students with a STEM (Science Technology Engineeringn and Math) is on the rise. Computer Science skills are especially important in today's job market. So I volunteered to start a CS class at our high school without actually having a strong background in it. 

I have published this code and made it public for a variety of reasons. The first of which is that Git is new to me and I need the practice. It is a tool that I wish to teach my students in class and I must learn it first. Second, I want my students to see how the website works (such as it is). It's not overly complicated and I mean for students to learn from it. Many of my students are smarter than I am and they will learn as much from my mistakes as their own.

Starting with a simple site I hope my students will learn some of the following topics:

- html
- CSS
- JavaScript
- php
- MySQL

Anyway, that's the list with an order I think makes sense. And that's the order I'm going to follow building this site. This site was relaunched on April 21, 2014 with just html. The other features are being added over time.

I may revisit the decision to not include one of the popular CMS packages in the future but for now I want the students to get the idea of what can be accomplished in a text editor and at the command-line.

The site is currently behind a firewall and accessible only on our school Intranet. I hope to get out IT staff to route it through the firewall.  If that happens you can visit at this address [http://cse.gjcs.k12.in.us](http://cse.gjcs.k12.in.us). I'm not holding out hope that they will purchase an SSL certificate so it will be unencrypted for now.
