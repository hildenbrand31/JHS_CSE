	<h1>I like to put a headline on my pages.</h1>
	<h2> You may use the &#60;h2&#62; tag to create a subhead</h2>
	<p>My first paragraph. A paragraph can contain many sentences. You can even add an in-line link with the &#60;a&#62; tag. My personal website can be reached by clicking this <a href="http://www.fredroutson.com">link.</a> It has not been updated in a very long time.</p>
	<p>Images are also easy to add to your website.  You only have to know the address of where the picture is on the web.  Many times the picture is stored on the same server as your page. In some cases you may link to a picture that is hosted on a different server, such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr.</a></p>
